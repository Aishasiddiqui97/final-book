# Module 1: ROS 2 Nervous System

Welcome to the first module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module introduces the Robot Operating System (ROS 2) as the "nervous system" of robotics applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the architecture and concepts of ROS 2
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes
- Implement message passing and services
- Configure parameter management and launch files
- Develop real-time control systems

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge
- Understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with command line interfaces

## Table of Contents

This module contains the following chapters:
- Introduction to Physical AI and ROS 2
- ROS 2 Nodes and Architecture
- Message Passing and Services
- Parameter Management and Launch Files
- Real-time Control Systems

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) provides the framework and tools for developing robotic applications. In this module, we'll explore how ROS 2 serves as the nervous system for robots, enabling communication between different components and facilitating the development of complex robotic behaviors.
