# Introduction to Physical AI and ROS 2

This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of Physical AI and the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), which serve as the backbone for developing sophisticated robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional AI
- Identify key components of humanoid robots
- Explain the relationship between AI and physical embodiment
- Describe applications of humanoid robotics in various domains
- Understand the role of ROS 2 in robotics development

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces to AI that operates in the physical world. Unlike classical AI systems that process data and make decisions in virtual environments, Physical AI systems must navigate the complexities of the real world, including:

- **Real-time constraints**: Physical systems must respond within strict time limits
- **Uncertainty**: Sensor data is often noisy and incomplete
- **Embodiment**: The physical form affects how the system can interact with the world
- **Safety considerations**: Physical systems must operate safely around humans and environments

## The Role of ROS 2

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) provides the infrastructure for developing robotic applications. It offers:

- **Communication framework**: Enables different components to exchange information
- **Hardware abstraction**: Allows code to run on different hardware platforms
- **Common tools**: Provides utilities for debugging, visualization, and testing
- **Ecosystem**: A rich set of libraries and tools developed by the community

## Key Components of Humanoid Robots

Humanoid robots typically include:

- **Sensors**: Cameras, LIDAR, IMUs, force/torque sensors
- **Actuators**: Motors, servos, pneumatic/hydraulic systems
- **Computing platform**: Onboard computers for processing
- **Power systems**: Batteries and power management
- **Structure**: The physical frame and joints

## Applications of Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots have diverse applications including:

- **Assistive robotics**: Helping elderly or disabled individuals
- **Industrial applications**: Performing complex tasks in manufacturing
- **Research platforms**: Advancing robotics and AI research
- **Entertainment**: Interactive robots for education and entertainment

## Lab Exercise

Set up your ROS 2 environment and run a simple publisher-subscriber example to understand the basic communication patterns in ROS 2.

## Summary

This chapter established the foundation for understanding Physical AI and introduced ROS 2 as the framework for developing robotic applications. The next chapter will dive deeper into ROS 2 nodes and architecture.
