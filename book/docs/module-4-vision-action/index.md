- Implement vision-language models for robotics
- Design action planning and execution systems
- Control humanoid robots with complex behaviors
- Integrate all concepts from previous modules
- Complete a comprehensive robotics project

## Prerequisites

- All previous modules (ROS 2, Simulation, AI Integration)
- Understanding of computer vision concepts
- Experience with planning algorithms

## Table of Contents

This module contains the following chapters:
- Vision-Language Models
- Action Planning and Execution
- Humanoid Robot Control
- Complete Project Integrating All Concepts

## Overview

This capstone module brings together all the concepts from the previous modules to create sophisticated humanoid robots capable of understanding natural language, perceiving their environment, and executing complex tasks.
